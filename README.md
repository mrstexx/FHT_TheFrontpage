Final Project for Bachelor Thesis "**Evaluation of GraphQL and REST API Performance in a Spring Boot Web Application**" at University of Applied Sciences Technikum in Vienna.

#### Abstract
This paper is about performance evaluation between GraphQL and REST API in a Spring Boot application. Since the amount and complexity of data increased in recent years, Facebook introduced in 2015 GraphQL, a query language created for developing APIs and flexible data exchange between services. On the other side is REST, an architectural style used for more than a decade for developing APIs. The paper describes the foundation and theoretical differences between these two approaches including their benefits and limitations. The performance test and evaluation are based on quantitative metrics whose values are received from the prepared experiment. In the end, it shows what is the GraphQL performance compared to REST API over prepared experiment scenarios.

Name of the the application is **TheFrontpage**.

The repository contains four main directories:
 - Client implementation in `thefrontpage-client`
 - Backend implementation in `thefrontpage-server`
 - Database schema in `h2-database`
 -  JMeter tests in `jmeter-tests`
